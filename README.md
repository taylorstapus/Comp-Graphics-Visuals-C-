The SceneManager.cpp file includes methods that define and call low-polygon 3D representations of real-word objects including planes, boxes, cylinder, pyraminds and spheres.
Texture were accurately applied to the 3D models by defining and implementing the source jpg images.
2 different lightings (spotlight and directional) including componets such as ambient, diffuse and specular were added to enhance the life like texures of the scene. The texure were also define as paticular materials to the reflect the light in the apporprite manner.

The ViewManage.cpp file included input and camera functions. The camera has the capabitily to fly around the scene using key binding WASD ans well as QE to move up and downwards. The mouse scroll wheel was binded to allow the user to zoom in and out of the scene. Key OP were used to allow the viewer to change perspcetive between perspective and orthographic 

All files include best practices by providing code that is easy to read and follow. The code is breifly and clearly explained and runs as expected.
